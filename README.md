# Lanraragi React Web

A react based front-end application for making use of the [Lanraragi](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi) api. Works best on mobile and tablet viewports, but the desktop experience is okay.

## Features

- The app makes use of the Client API to interact with [LANraragi](https://github.com/Difegue/LANraragi) and get access to things like archive, thumbnails, images, categories, etc.

- Read archives (only tested .cbz/.zip files, other supported LRR file formats need testing) from your favorite web browsers on any device.

- Though the app can be run in the browser, for a better viewing experience, feel free to make use of the app's capabilities as a progressive web abb and download it on to your device for a cleaner experience without things like address bars or navigation buttons getting in the way.
